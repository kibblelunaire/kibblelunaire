👋 I’m Rald [he/him]. A full-stack developer from the Philippine archipelago that relies on StackOverflow and coffee ☕ \
🛠️ I’m interested in making things that are functional, useful and accessible (for me, others or everyone) \
🌱 I'm currently self-learning front-end and back-end programming languages as they peaked my interest.

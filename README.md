### 👋 ｜ Oh hi! Didn't see you there

Heya! I'm Kibble. I like to fiddle around with stuff that I'm not supposed to fiddle with.

---

〽️  ｜  What do you do for a living
- Make Discord bots that will get deleted/deprecated later.
- Play games (such as: Genshin Impact, Minecraft, and Roblox)
- Web development

🌱  ｜  What projects am I working on?
- [Tranquil](https://github.com/ivnsrrn/tranquil), an upcoming music bot.
- [osuAutoBot](https://github.com/ivnsrrn/osuAutoBot), some bot for the game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)
  - I am not responsible for any damages, you can compile and build the code for yourself.
  - This is not game-friendly and will result in an immediate account ban if used.

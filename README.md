### 👋 ｜ Oh hi! Didn't see you there

Heya! I'm Rald and I'm from the [🇵🇭 Philippines](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Philippines/).  I'm a 9th grader that likes to fiddle around with stuff that I'm not supposed to fiddle with. I'm a JavaScript enthusiast (35% good at it). And that's what I basically do for a living.

> 〽️  ｜  What do you do for a living?
> - Currently learning how to reverse engineer games.
> - Make Discord bots that will get deleted/deprecated later.
> - I do web development when I have the time

> 🥀  ｜  Stale projects (projects that have a 25% of being archived)
> - [osuAutoBot](https://github.com/sigmatuse4/osuAutoBot), some bot for the game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)
>   - This is not game/multiplayer friendly and will result in an immediate account ban if used. Please use it offline. \
>   _I haven't released an executable version but I will in the future, I will give you segfault if you use it online._

> 🌱  ｜  What projects am I working on?
> - I am currently not planning to revive some projects because I'm really lazy to code.

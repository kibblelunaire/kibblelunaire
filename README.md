### 👋 ｜ Oh hi! Didn't see you there

Heya! I'm Sigma and I'm from the [🇵🇭 Philippines](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Philippines/) and I like to fiddle around with stuff that I'm not supposed to fiddle with. Exploring the wonderful world of programming is my hobby, I'm a JavaScript enthusiast but I'm still learning and still bad at it. This quarantine stuff became a hassle but I guess this is the current hobby that'll entertain me until it's over.
